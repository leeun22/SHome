<h2> Description </h2>
<p align="justify"> 
  SHOME is a scientific research project of a group of three students. Over the 4 years of study, we are students. We realize the difficulties, risks latent when we rent a home not only for students but also fears with people far from our hometown to the city to work. Therefore, with the knowledge that teachers convey back in four school years, we have built up the SHOME website - providing multi-service accommodation for students, employees and tenants. With the desire to help people easily find themselves a suitable, convenient and fastest inn. 
  
  This topic is still in the process of updating, so shortcomings cannot be avoided and some bugs...Hope teachers and brothers and sisters will wait for the latest version of the group in the coming time. 
  
  I'm sincere thanks!
